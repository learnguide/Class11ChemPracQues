The radius of cation is smaller than the parent atom. Cation is formed by the loss of one or more electron from the gaseous atom, but the nuclear charge remains the same. As a result, the nuclear hold on the remaining electrons increases because of the increases in the effective nuclear change per electron resulting in decrease in size. Whereas anion is formed by the gain of one or more electrons by the gaseous atom but the nuclear charge is same though the number of electrons has increased. The effective nuclear charge per electron decrease in the anion and the cloud is held less tightly by the nucleus.

Why are elements at the extreme left and extreme right the most reactive? Ans. The maximum chemical reactivity at the extreme left (among alkali metals) is exhibited due to the loss of an electron leading to the formation of a cation due to low ionization 8 ","enthalpy and at the extreme right (among halogens) shown by the gain of an electron forming an anion. Due to high electron affinity. 18. Why does the ionization enthalpy gradually decreases in a group? Ans. In a group, the increase in atomic and ionic radii with increase in atomic number generally results in a gradual decrease in ionization enthalpies. 19. Why does electronegativity value increases across a period and decreases down period? Ans. The attraction between the outer electrons and the nucleus increases as the atomic radius decreases in a period. The electeonegativity also increases. On the same account electronegativity value decreases with the increase in atomic radii down a group. 20.How does electronegativity and non – metallic character related to each other? Ans. Electronegativity is directly related to the non – metallic character of elements. Electronegativity is inversely related to the metallic properties of elements. Thus the increase in electronegativities across a period is accompanied by an increase in non – metallic properties of elements. Similarly, the decrease in electronegativity down a group is accompanies by a decrease in non – metallic properties of elements. 21.Describe the main features of Mendeleev’s periodic table?

In SO 2 , the number of bonding pairs is 4 where it has an lone pair of electron which does not participate in bond formation thereby repulsive strain is experienced. 19.Why does H 2 O have bent structure? Ans. In water molecule, there are two bonding pairs and two lone pairs of electrons. The shape should have been tetrahedral if there were all bp but two lp are present. Thus the shaped is distorted to an angular shape. Because lp – lp repulsion is more than lp – bp repulsion. 20.For the molecule, Why is structure (b) more stable than structure (a)? Ans. In (a) the lp is present at axial position so there are three lp – bp repulsions at 90 0 . Whereas in (b) the lp is in an equatorial position are there are two lp – bp repulsions. Hence, arrangement (b) is more stable than (a). 21.How would you attribute the structure of PH 3 molecule using VSEPR model? Ans. Phosphorus atom has 5 electrons in its outermost orbit. H – atoms contribute one electron each to make in all 8 electron around P – atom. Thus 4 pairs of electrons would be distributed in a tetrahedral manner around the central atom. Three pairs from three P – H 13 ","bonds while the fourth pair remains unused. Due to repulsion between the bp and lp, the shape is not of tetrahedral but trigonal pyramidal molecule. 22.In SF 4 molecule, the lp electrons occupies an equatorial position in the trigonal bipyramidal arrangement to an axial position. Give reason. Ans. In SF 4 molecule, the lp electrons occupies an equatorial position because, lp – bp repulsion is minimum. 23.How is VBT different from Lewis concept? Ans.

Why? Ans. S – Orbital does not show any preference for direction because it is spherically symmetrical. 25.Why is s– bond stronger than - bond? Ans. Orbitals can overlap to a greater extent in a s - bond due to axial orientation, so s - bond is strong. Whereas, in a pi – bond sideways overlapping is not to an appreciable extent due to the presence of s - bond which restricts the distance between the involved atoms. 26.What are the different types of s - bond formation? Ans. s - bond can be formed by any of the following types of combinations of atoms orbitals. (a) S – S – overlapping : In this case, there is a overlap of two half – filled S – orbitals along the inter nuclear axis. 14 ","(b) S- P overlapping : This type of over lapping occurs between half – filled s-orbitals of one atom and half-filled p-orbitals of another atom.

In case of ethylene, hybridization where the four hydrogen atoms 16 ","are placed in four corners of a plane sharing Whereas acetylene shows sp hybridization and shares an angle of and thus it is linear. 32.In H 2 O, H 2 S, H 2 Se, H 2 Te, the bond angle decreases though all have the same bent shape. Why? Ans. In all the four cases, the molecules undergo hybridization forming four hybrid orbitals, two of which are occupied by lp of electrons and two by bp electrons. Thus they are expected to have angle but this does not happen. In case of molecule, as oxygen is small in size and has high electronegativity value, the bp are closer due to which it is subjected to larger repulsion (bp-bp). In case of as S atom is larger than O, bp-bp repulsion is less as compared to and it is true for as well. 33.Out of p-orbital and sp-hybrid orbital which has greater directional character and Why? Ans. Sp-hybrid orbital has greater directional character than p-orbital. Because in case of p-orbitals, the two lobes are equal in size and equal electron density is distributed whereas in Sp-hybrid orbital, electron density is greater on one side. 34. does not exist.

(ii) Interaction between lone pair of chloride ion and Si 4+ is not very strong. 8.PbI 4 does not exist. Why? Ans. PbI 4 does not exist because Pb – I bond initially formed during the reaction does not release enough energy to unpair 6s 2 electrons and excite one of them to higher orbital to have four unpaired electrons around lead atom. 9.Why is carbon different from other member of the group? Ans. Carbon differs from rest of the members of its group due to its smaller size, higher electro negativity, higher ionization enthalpy and unavailability of d-orbital’s. 10.Why does the covalence of carbon not expand beyond four? Ans. In carbon, only s and p orbital’s are available for bonding and therefore it can accommodate only four pairs of electrons around it. This limit the maximum covalence to four whereas other members can expand their covalence due to the presence of d-orbital’s. 7 ","11.Why does carbon show different allotropic forms? Ans.

Hence, Si does not exhibit graphite structure. 13.Why does graphite conduct electricity? Ans. Graphite forms hexagonal ring and undergoes sp 2 hybridization. The electrons are delocalized over the whole sheet. Electrons are mobile and therefore graphite conducts electricity over the sheet. 14.Graphite is used as lubricant. Give reason. Ans. Graphite has sp 2 hybridized carbon with a layer structure due to wide separation and weak inter – layer bonds the two adjacent layers can easily slide over each other. This makes graphite act as a lubricant. 15.How are silicones manufactured? Ans. They are manufactured by hydrolysis of chlorosilanes – where R is a methyl or phenyl group. 8 ","16.Why does CO 2 have a linear shape with no dipole moment Ans. In CO 2 molecule carbon atom undergoes sp hybridization. Two sp hybridized orbital of carbon atom overlap with two p-orbital’s of oxygen atoms to make two sigma bonds while other two electrons of carbon atom are involved in pπ – pπ bonding with oxygen atom. This results in its linear shape [with both c-o bond of equal length (115 pm)] with no dipole moment. 9 ","CBSE Class 12 Chemistry Important Questions Chapter 11 The p-Block Elements 3 Marks Questions 1.Why carbon does not form ionic compounds?

N – pentane has higher boiling point than neopentane but the melting point of neopentane is higher than that of n – pentane. Ans .Because of the presence of branches in neo-pentane the surface area and van der walls forces of attraction are very weak in neopentane than in n-pentane. Therefore the b.p of neopentane is lower than that of n-pentane. M.P depends upon the packing of the molecules in the crystal lattice.
